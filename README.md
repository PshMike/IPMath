# IPMath
PowerShell functions related to IP Address and subnetting

I set out to create these based on the need to want to create Boundary objects in SCCM based on IP ranges. This requires setting a name for the boundary object as well as the first and last IP address to assign to the boundary. Using this function makes that task simple.
